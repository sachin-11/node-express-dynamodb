# Demo Node.js, Express.js, and DynamoDB Application

This is a simple demo project that demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to interact with Amazon DynamoDB for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a DynamoDB table.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- An AWS account with DynamoDB access credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) configured.
- AWS DynamoDB table created (in this example, we assume a table named `items`).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sachin-11/demo-node-express-dynamodb.git
   cd demo-node-express-dynamodb
